# Admin-Dashboard-Project

**Admin Dashboard Project for The Odin Project**

## Overview

This project is a dashboard layout built using HTML and CSS Grid, featuring a sidebar, header, and main content sections including projects, announcements, and trending items. Itâ€™s designed as a practice project for mastering grid layouts and CSS styling.

## Setup

Initialize Project

Create a Git repository.

Set up your HTML and CSS files with dummy content to confirm links.

## Layout

Structure the main containers: sidebar, header, and main content.

Apply CSS Grid to create the basic layout.

Nesting & Sections

Nest child elements inside parent containers using grids.

Sidebar: navigation and branding sections.

Header: search bar, user info, buttons.

Main content: projects, announcements, trending items.

Use dummy content and placeholders to position elements.

## Assets & Styling

Download icons (Material Design Icons or SVGs) and choose fonts (e.g., Roboto from Google Fonts).

Customize the design and colors as desired.

## Tips

Apply temporary background colors or borders to visualize grid areas.

Use pixels, fr units, or a combination for grid sizing.

Responsiveness is optional; grid items can adjust with browser resizing.

Focus on practicing CSS skills rather than achieving a pixel-perfect match.

Push your finished project to GitHub and optionally deploy via GitHub Pages.
